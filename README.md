# Overview

## Installation and Use

1. Follow the instructions to [install Julia](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/getting_started.html#Installing-Julia-and-Dependencies)

2. Install the package, open the Julia REPL (see the documentation above) and then run

```julia 
using Pkg 
pkg"dev https://github.com/jlperla/PerlaTonettiWaugh.jl.git" 
```

Consider dragging and dropping the folder into Github Desktop or GitKraken in order to make changes. 

The folder will be installed in `~/.julia/dev/PerlaTonettiWaugh` on mac/linux and in somewhere like `C:\Users\USERNAME\.julia\dev\PerlaTonettiWaugh` on Windows

If you are having trouble finding it, then (in the REPL) run 
```julia
joinpath(DEPOT_PATH[1], "dev", "PerlaTonettiWaugh")
```

3. Startup a terminal or Windows Powershell and navigate to that directory.  Then type
```bash
jupyter lab
```
to open a browser with the Jupyter notebooks

4. Within the main directory, the notebook `solve-transition.ipynb` has code to solve the model in steady state and on a transition path between steady states. 
   * After opening the notebook, `Ctrl-A` to select the whole notebook and then `Shift-Enter` to run it, or just shift enter between cells
    * The first time it runs, **it will a long time** since it needs to install package dependencies.  Afterwards, it will be faster when you open the notebook.  However, it will still take a few minutes each time you run it the first time (and a few seconds thereafter).
    * At the end, there is a call to the `solve_continuation` method, which returns a relatively robust solution by smoothly changing the `d_0` parameter from a known steady-state. 
5. There is also the `solve-simple-transition.ipynb` notebook to solve the simple variation of the model described in the notes.
