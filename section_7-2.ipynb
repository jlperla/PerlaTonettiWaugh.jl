    "\n",
    "As stated earlier, we set ζ = 1 as a normalization. Several comments are in order regarding this normalization. First, calibrating the model with a different normalization results in identical parameter values for all parameters except κ. In the theoretical analysis, equations (33) and (35) show that ζ only appears in the form ζ/κ. Thus, a different choice of ζ results in a different κ to match the g and λii moments.\n",
    "Different normalizations do lead to a different amount of variety as equation (48) shows. However, as equation (53) shows, any combination of ζ and κ results in the same welfare gains from trade as long as λ_ii and all other parameter values are equal. It is in this sense that ζ = 1 is a normalization. Numerical analysis of the quantitative model confirms these observations both for steady-state comparative statics\n",
